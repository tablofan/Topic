# Painting Restoration using Deep Neural Networks
## For Topics in Computer Science, Semester 2 2022

Motivated by the idea that the computer vision based image inpainting process could be an efficient solution for this purpose, in this project, we propose a framework that employs a deep neural network-based approach to inpainting artworks from the period of the Italian Renaissance. The proposed framework aims to inpaint damaged or missing regions of irregular shapes and sizes and demonstrate potential applications in restoration of other historical works.

## Quick start

### Using Docker

1. [Install Docker 19.03 or later:](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
```bash
curl https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo systemctl --now enable docker
```
2. [Install the NVIDIA container toolkit:](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
   && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
   && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
3. [Download and run the image:](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/milesial/unet)
```bash
make build
make run
```

4. Run the image as Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
make jupyter
python train.py --amp
```

## Usage
**Note : Use Python 3.6 or newer**

### Docker

A docker image containing the code and the dependencies is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/milesial/unet).
You can download and jump in the container with ([docker >=19.03](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)):

```console
docker run -it --rm --shm-size=8g --ulimit memlock=-1 --gpus all milesial/unet
```


### Training

```console
> python train.py -h
usage: train.py [-h] [--epochs E] [--batch-size B] [--learning-rate LR]
                [--load LOAD] [--scale SCALE] [--validation VAL] [--amp]

Train the UNet on images and target masks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epochs E, -e E      Number of epochs
  --batch-size B, -b B  Batch size
  --learning-rate LR, -l LR
                        Learning rate
  --load LOAD, -f LOAD  Load model from a .pth file
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Downscaling factor of the images
  --validation VAL, -v VAL
                        Percent of the data that is used as validation (0-100)
  --amp                 Use mixed precision
```

By default, the `scale` is 0.5, so if you wish to obtain better results (but use more memory), set it to 1.

Automatic mixed precision is also available with the `--amp` flag. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) allows the model to use less memory and to be faster on recent GPUs by using FP16 arithmetic. Enabling AMP is recommended.


### Prediction

After training your model and saving it to `MODEL.pth`, you can easily test the output masks on your images via the CLI.

To predict a single image and save it:

`python predict.py -i image.jpg -o output.jpg`

To predict a multiple images and show them without saving them:

`python predict.py -i image1.jpg image2.jpg --viz --no-save`

```console
> python predict.py -h
usage: predict.py [-h] [--model FILE] --input INPUT [INPUT ...] 
                  [--output INPUT [INPUT ...]] [--viz] [--no-save]
                  [--mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD] [--scale SCALE]

Predict masks from input images

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model FILE, -m FILE
                        Specify the file in which the model is stored
  --input INPUT [INPUT ...], -i INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of input images
  --output INPUT [INPUT ...], -o INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of output images
  --viz, -v             Visualize the images as they are processed
  --no-save, -n         Do not save the output masks
  --mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD, -t MASK_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum probability value to consider a mask pixel white
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Scale factor for the input images
```
You can specify which model file to use with `--model MODEL.pth`.

## Weights & Biases

The training progress can be visualized in real-time using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).  Loss curves, validation curves, weights and gradient histograms, as well as predicted masks are logged to the platform.

When launching a training, a link will be printed in the console. Click on it to go to your dashboard. If you have an existing W&B account, you can link it
 by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable. If not, it will create an anonymous run which is automatically deleted after 7 days.


## Data

The dataset containing artworks by Titian can be found in 'data/imgs/Titian'. It contains 251 artworks by the Italian Renaissance painter Titian.

The input images and target masks should be in the `data/imgs` and `data/masks` folders respectively (note that the `imgs` and `masks` folder should not contain any sub-folder or any other files, due to the greedy data-loader).
